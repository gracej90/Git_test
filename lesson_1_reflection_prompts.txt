How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

The differences were clearly presented using diff.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Having the history allows you to see the changes made over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

The pro would be you would be more conscious about which changes to track.
Con would be you will have to remember to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because often there are several files needed to run a program.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git diff shows the difference or updates between 2 files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You would be easily able to switch back to the older version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Building a working project!
